                        Breaking Bad is an AMC show that ran from 2008 to 2013 with 5 seasons and became the biggest show on AMC next to the Walking Dead. It soon made it way 
                        to Netflix which then became Netflix's biggest show until Squid Game out in 2020. Though being beat, it trends constantly on Netflix because
                        of how watchable it is. Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a 50-year old, over-qualified high school chemistry who longs to become something
                        more as he reaches the age of 50. After his 50th birthday, he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Now faced with potential death, he goes on a ride along with his 
                        DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, to witness a meth drug-bust ran by his former chemsitry student Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, who seemingly gets away. This sparks something in Walt
                        feeling as this is his way to make serious money for his family before he dies of cancer. He catches up with Jesse and offers a partnership to cook meth together. The series 
                        then goes showing the dangerous path Walt and Jesse set on and the slow change from Walt being a frail chemistry teacher, to a narcissitic meth kingpin.

                        Black Mirror is an anthology series that is ongoging currently and has 3 seasons that streams on Netflix. This show started off in the UK before being picked up
                        from Netflix and began mixing American actors with British actors. The show is an anthology which means each episode is its own story so you can watch out of
                        order. People refer to it as the "modern Twilight Zone" as it remeninsce the chilling and dark stories that almost feel like they can happen in the real world.
                        The modern part is where it gets its praise since these dark stories are told around the confides of technology in our world such as phones and social media but can
                        because very accurate in their depiction; even the name "Black Mirror" represents the reflection we see when our phone screen is off. Also, just like the Twilight zone, each story has their twist at the end which keeps things refreshing when watching.

                            The Boys is an ongoing series you can watch on Amazon Prime Video. The Boys is very popular right now since its new season has just released. In a nutshell,
                            The Boys is a series where humans live amongst other humans with super powers, but except it being glits and glamour like the cartoons, the superheros in the 
                            show are egotistical and narcissitic and few ever care about anyone but themselves. This leads to a lot of gory and provoking scenes in the show as you see 
                            superheroes and humans dying or getting seriously injured. You follow a group of humans called The Boys, who even though lack super powers, they try to find ways
                            to dispose of bad super heroes, with their biggest target being Homelander(Evil Superman essentially). The show is extremely graphic but very entertaining and is worth the watch.

                                One Punch Man is an anime that was adapted by the manga of the same name in 2015 and released on Netflix with its first season. The anime quickly gained
                                popularity for its paroding of over the top action animes and provides a great comedic element to the show. You follow a super hero named Saitama who became
                                so powerful that he is essentially invincible and can kill any villian with one punch, which has left him a shell of his formal self as he longs for a challenge
                                since he's too powerful. Saitama prior to his power, was just a normal human with a corperate job who wanted to be more. After saving a child from a villain he 
                                realizes that being a hero is his true passion and begins to train for 3 years and eventually becomes too strong to the point of invincibility. You follow Saitama
                                on his life meeting new people and fighting monsters but never getting recognition for his heroic acts by chance no one ever sees it which adds to the comedic element
                                Even if your not into anime, this one is always a good watch since it makes fun of other animes and you can have a good laugh.

                        <p>
                            Better Call Saul is an ongoing series on Netflix that is the prequel to Breaking Bad. You follow the life before crime of Saul Goodman, the crooked criminal
                            lawyer from Breaking Bad. Just like Walt, you follow his path from becoming a small con-man to a criminal lawyer who uses loopholes and illegal methods to 
                            get the biggest criminals out of trouble. This show has the great writing of Breaking Bad but with a twist that shocked a lot of people when it first came out.
                            Breaking Bad was a bit more intense because of its near death experiences with some characters but with this show a lot of it is a slow burn but still keeps you entertained.
                            The show starts to heat of as the season goes as it slowly starts connecting to Breaking Bad but the writing is very good as you watch Saul Goodman use his charismatic and 
                            pursuasive personality to get out of any trouble. If you're a Breaking Bad fan, you will for sure enjoy this one.
